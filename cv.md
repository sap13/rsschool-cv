 ### Summary:
 I am 27 years old and most of my life has been devoted to computers. It all started in 2003 with computer games. After friends asked to help them install Windows, games and so on. After that, my parents organized a small business selling computer equipment, and I had to help them in their work. After studying at the department of electronic computing tools, I fully began working with computers in the field of repair and maintenance. In 2019, I moved to Minsk and am doing the same thing now. More recently, I decided to try myself in programming. I searched for courses suitable for me and stumbled upon the wonderful community "The Rolling Scopes School".Of course, there is not enough time catastrophically, to combine both work and study, but I try my best to study a new direction, drawing information from books, videos, and broadcasts. I really want to become a successful programmer, and be a sought after and highly paid specialist in the market.
